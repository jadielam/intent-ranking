HIGGAION Psalm 92:3 .(According to Gesenius, it signifies the murmuring tone of a harp, and hence that 

the music should be rendered in a plaintive manner.) Psalm 9:16 .(Combined with "Selah," it may have 

been intended to indicate a pause in the vocal music while the instruments rendered an interlude.) Psalm 

19:14 .(Mendelssohn translates it "meditation, thought." Hence, the music was to be rendered in a mode to

promote devout meditation.) -MAKALATH, MASCHIL, LEANNOTH .These terms are found in the titles 
of Psalm 53:1; 88:1 .(Authorities grope in darkness as to their signification. They may indicate the 
instruments to be played, or the melody to be sung) -MASCHIL .This musical sign occurs in the titles of 
Psalm 32:1; 42:1; 44:1; 45:1; 52:1; 53:1; 54:1; 55:1; 74:1; 78:1; 88:1; 89:1; 142:1 .(The meaning is 
obscure. But its signification where it occurs elsewhere than in the titles of Psalms is equivalent to the 
English word "instruction," or to become wise by instruction; hence, Psalm 47:7: " Sing ye praises with 
understanding.") -MICAHTAM A musical term in the titles of Psalm 16:1; 56:1; 57:1; 58:1; 59:1; 60:1 
.(Luther interprets this as "golden," that is, "precious." Ewald interprets it as signifying a plaintive manner.) 
-MUTH-LABBEN .In the title of Psalm 9: 1 .(Authorities, ancient and modern, differ as to the probable 
signification. Gesenius and Deuteronomy Wette interpret it, "with the voice of virgins, by boys." Others 
derive the word from a different Hebrew root, and interpret it as indicating that the Psalm was a funeral 
ode.) -NEGINAH and NEGINOTH Appear in the titles of Psalm 4:1; 54:1; 55:1; 61:1; 67:1; Hab 3:19 .(Its 
use seems to have been to indicate that the song should be accompanied by stringed instruments.) - 
NEHILOTH Appears in the title of Psalm 5:1 .(It seems to indicate, according to Gesenius, that when this 
Psalm was sung it was to be accompanied by wind instruments.) -SELAH .(This term appears frequently in 
the Psalms. Its use is not known. Possibly it signified a pause in the vocal music while an instrumental 
interlude or finale was rendered.) -SHEMINITH .In the titles of Psalm 6:1; 12: 1 .(Translated "eighth," 
probably indicates the measure, movement, or pitch.) -SHIGGAION .In the title of Psalm 7:1 And its 
plural, SHIGIONOTH, in the title of Hab 3:1 .(Supposed to be a musical term to guide in rendering the 
song. At the close of the chapter, the author refers the ode "to the chief musician, on my stringed 
instruments." The term may suggest the movement in interpreting the music set to it.) -SHOSHANNIM and 
SHUSHAN-EDUTH .In the titles to Psalm 45: 1 ; 60: 1 ; 69: 1 ; 80: 1 .(Seems to indicate the manner in which 
these Psalms were to be rendered. Kimchi, Tremellius, and Eichhorn render it "hexachorda," that is, that in 
singing these Psalms instruments of six strings were to accompany.)
